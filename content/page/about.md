Welcome to my blog. I am software engineer by profession at a semiconductor
company and a programmer by passion. Oh! I am an open source contributor too
:-). In my blog you might find topics mostly about technology in the areas that I either
work on or am curious about. Apart from my professional commitments, you could
find me...

- reading books, mostly non-fiction and self help

- keeping myself fit, believe in running(a lot)

- tinkering and learning new technologies and trying them out in my home projects

- spending quality time with family and friends

**Interested to know more about my work?**

In my current capacity I write code to enable various cutting edge features of latest revision of Adreno Graphics hardware. I also lead efforts to help commercialize Graphics software for a variety of Android and Chrome products. I have experience developing architectures and solutions in both the user space and in the kernel space.

Some of my recent open source contributions in Linux kernel
- [Preemption support](https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10241341/)
- [GPU scheduler support](https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/50388/)
- [All kernel contributions](https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/project/dri-devel/list/?submitter=17315)
